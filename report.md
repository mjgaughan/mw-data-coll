## Overview

> Maintainability index: üü¢ 108

| Language | LOC | Maintainability | Complexity per method | Average lines per method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **PHP** | 5.2 K | üü¢ 108 | 0.96 | 13 || **Python** | 821 | üü° 74 | 4.00 | 27 |

> - **LOC**: The number of lines of code.
> - **Complexity per method**: The average complexity of the code, measured by the number of possible execution paths. Lower is better.
> - **Average lines per method**: Long methods are hard to maintain and understand. Ideally, should be lower than 20.
> - **Maintainability**: Based on the volume, the complexity of operators and the complexity of the code. Ideally, should be higher than 85.

## Candidates for refactoring

These components have a low maintainability index and have been recently modified. They are good candidates for refactoring.

> - **Bus Factor**: The bus factor is the number of developers that would need to be incapacitated before a project would stall due to insufficient knowledge or skills.Ideally, should be higher than 3.
> - **Top contributors**: The developers that have contributed the most to the project. It's important to have a diverse group of contributors to avoid the bus factor.
> - **Commits**: The number of commits in the last 12 months. A high number of commits can indicate a high level of activity, but it can also indicate a high level of churn.
